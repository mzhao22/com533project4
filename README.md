# An Introduction about C language
In nowadays, many of you have already heard about C language. This topic would appear from your professors, your friends, and also students who study in Computer major. But what is C language and what does it do?

As we all know, the C language is a computer programming language. It has not only the characteristics of the advanced language, but also the assembly language.

It can be used as a system design language, write working system application programs, or also can be used as application programming language, and write applications that do not depend on computer hardware.

Therefore, it has a wide range of applications. C language is used for operation system and system operation and operation of hardware. 
C language is obviously superior to other interpretive high-level languages, and some large application softwares are also written in C language. By knowing C language and knowing how to use C language would make you a top programmer for any other kinds of languages can be related, or look similar to C language. 

C language has strong drawing ability, portability and strong data processing ability, so it is suitable for writing system software, 3D, 2D graphics and animations. 

It is the advanced language of numerical computation. C language commonly used IDE (integrated development environment) Microsoft Visual C++, Borland C++, Watcom C++, Borland C++, Borland C++ Builder, Borland C++ 3.1 for DOS, Watcom C++ 11 for DOS, GNU DJGPP C++, Lccwin32 C Compiler 3.1, Microsoft C, High C, Turbo C and so on.
